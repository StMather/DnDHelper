Dungeon Helper

Description:

What your application does or what problem it solves?
The Dungeon Helper was created to off load some of challanges that I have seen with players and encountered myself. The application allows the player to track, update and use stats that normal get lost on the second or 3rd page of a character sheet or are harder to calculate on the fly. The dungeon master page will allow the tracking of important monster data for the dungeon master but in a way that allows the players to also see the monsters in a way that is more helpful to them without givign away secretive data.

Which technologies you chose?
I chose to use React JS, HTML and CSS.

Features you hope to implement in the future
In the future I would like to add players to the dungeon master page with information that would be usefull for the dungeon master. I also want to add Spells, Rules and Conditons for easy look up of buried infromation. 

(Optional) Challenges you faced
React, Api calls and waiting for results, React rendering
